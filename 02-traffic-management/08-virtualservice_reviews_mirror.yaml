metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts: # destinations that these routing rules apply to. VirtualService must be bound to the gateway and must have one or more hosts that match the hosts specified in a server
  - reviews
  gateways: # names of gateways and sidecars that should apply these routes
  - bookinfo-gateway # Don't ONLY USE this gateway as "reviews" k8s service is used internally by productpage service, so this VS rule should be applied to Envoy sidecar proxy inside reviews pod, not edge proxy in gateway pod. 
  - mesh # applies to all the sidecars in the mesh. The reserved word mesh is used to imply all the sidecars in the mesh. When gateway field is omitted, the default gateway (mesh) will be used, which would apply the rule to all sidecars in the mesh. If a list of gateway names is provided, the rules will apply only to the gateways. To apply the rules to both gateways and sidecars, specify mesh as one of the gateway names.
